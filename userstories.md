1) I am a marketing researcher and I need a way to determine which of the 25 potential items for manufacturing will be selected as the most interesting of the items by focus groups, which will be part of the analysis for what to manufacture.
2) I am a focus group member and I like to be able to provide unbiased results to marketers with a clean layout that doesn't cause inherent bias.
3) I am a developer that wants to write clean code with comments and provide the client with an website that will help focus groups to determine which of the 25 images are most interesting by showing them in 3 side by side images at a time and track the results to be shown back on the page after 25 total clicks.
4) I am a bus mall exec and I want to make sure that since we do not have as much capital up front that we are making the wisest selections in our catalogs for Seattlites.  I want the products to be ones that cause people to take note of our magazine and let it be known by name much like our sky-based peers.
